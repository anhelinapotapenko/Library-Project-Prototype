# ðŸ“š Library Services Web Prototype (Wireframe + Mockup + Style Tile)

This project is an interactive wireframe and early mockup for a Library Services website.  
It demonstrates the planned structure, content layout, and user flow prior to applying final UI styling and Tailwind CSS.  

The goal of this prototype is to define the interface skeleton, component behaviour, and overall navigation before building a fully styled, responsive design.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- Establish page structure and core content sections
- Visualize user pathways and interactions
- Identify priority information for students (hours, services, FAQ, contact)
- Test usability flow before high-fidelity UI design
- Prepare foundation for Tailwind UI implementation

- Clean, academic layout
- Light, neutral background tones
- Early icon usage for content meaning
- Typography placeholders (fonts to be applied later)
- Planned visual hierarchy & spacing foundation
- Future Tailwind CSS theme and color tokens to be added

## ðŸš§ Status
This is a **low-to-mid fidelity prototype**, not the final design.  
The next phase will include:
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Responsive behavior improvements
- High-fidelity UI elements
- Color palette & typography system (style tile)
- Final interaction polish and accessibility pass

This version demonstrates planning, structure, and interactive logic before full UI development.
